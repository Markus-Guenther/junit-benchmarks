Alternative 1: use maven only
-----------------------------

Prereq.: configured GPG, configured SonaType's server and user settings in ~/.m2/settings.xml as
explained in https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

Prereq.: You must be working on an SVN checkout.

mvn release:clean
mvn release:prepare          [AUTOMATICALLY creates an SVN/SCM tag, updates POM versions]
mvn release:perform          [Stages the release to SonaType.]

=> go to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/, close the release, check it and release to central



Alternative 2: semi-manual release
----------------------------------

=> Modify POM version info (remove -SNAPSHOT).
=> SCM commit, create a tag, maintenance branch if needed.

mvn -Prelease,maven-release  [creates release bundles and SonaType manual release bundle]

=> go to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/, upload the release manually, close, check, release.
