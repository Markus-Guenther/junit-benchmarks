WARNINGS
--------

* Benchmarking is *very* tricky in Java. JIT compilation type, dead code elimination 
  and other factors may affect your results (and seriously distort conclusions if you
  don't understand what they are).

* This project is implemented for tracking execution speed of JUnit test methods, so
  any overhead is included (JUnit runners, test rules, before-after hooks, etc.). If
  you need to measure nano-time scale, use JMH or Caliper:

  http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/
  https://code.google.com/p/caliper/

* Any @Before or @After hooks WILL BE EXECUTED AS PART OF THE BENCHMARK RUN. More
  information about why this is the case is provided here:
